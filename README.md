# Bridges of K√∂nigsberg Problem

Welcome to the **Bridges of K√∂nigsberg Problem** project! This web-based game was designed to help illustrate and teach the famous Bridges of K√∂nigsberg problem in discrete mathematics or graph theory classes. The problem serves as a foundational example of Eulerian paths and offers a fun, interactive way for students to understand important concepts in graph theory.

## üß† What is the K√∂nigsberg Bridge Problem?

The **Bridges of K√∂nigsberg** is a historic problem in mathematics, originating from the city of K√∂nigsberg (now Kaliningrad). The challenge is to devise a walk through the city that would cross each of its seven bridges exactly once. Leonhard Euler proved in 1736 that such a walk was impossible, which laid the groundwork for graph theory.

This project turns the K√∂nigsberg bridge problem into an **interactive web game** where users can attempt to cross the bridges without repeating any, helping them experience Euler‚Äôs famous result firsthand.

## üéÆ Features

- **Interactive graph**: The game allows users to click on nodes (representing landmasses) and edges (representing bridges) to simulate the crossing process.
- **Visual feedback**: Using the [Vis.js](https://visjs.org/) library for graph visualization and [Toastr](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/) for notifications, players get immediate feedback when selecting nodes and edges.
- **Educational tool**: Perfect for explaining Eulerian paths and cycles in a fun, engaging way during math or computer science classes.
- **Responsive design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices, ensuring a smooth user experience regardless of platform.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **[Vis.js](https://visjs.org/)**: A dynamic, browser-based visualization library to handle graph rendering.
- **[Toastr.js](https://codeseven.github.io/toastr/)**: A simple JavaScript library for non-blocking notifications.
- **HTML5 & JavaScript**: The game is built using HTML, JavaScript, and the libraries mentioned above.

## üöÄ How to Play

1. The game starts with a graph that represents the landmasses and bridges of K√∂nigsberg.
2. You must select a node (a landmass) to begin your journey.
3. After selecting a node, choose an edge (a bridge) that connects to your selected node.
4. Continue selecting nodes and edges, attempting to cross all bridges exactly once.
5. If you make an invalid move, you will receive a notification explaining the error.

## üéØ Objective

The goal is simple: try to cross all the bridges without crossing any bridge more than once. Can you figure out why it‚Äôs impossible? This will help illustrate Euler‚Äôs brilliant insight that sparked the field of graph theory.

## üåü Why Use This in Your Classroom?

This game makes abstract mathematical concepts tangible and interactive. It's perfect for:

- **Mathematics teachers** looking to explain graph theory concepts like Eulerian paths and circuits.
- **Computer science instructors** focusing on the importance of algorithms and discrete mathematics.
- **Students** who want a hands-on experience with one of the most famous problems in graph theory.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of **Eulerian paths** and the conditions under which they exist.
- Introduction to **graph theory** and its applications in real-world problems.
- Hands-on learning tool for **discrete mathematics** or **computational theory**.
